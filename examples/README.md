# Practical Examples & Validation

This directory contains practical implementations of the CP-Core schema, demonstrating how **The Stack** maintains integrity across different AI environments.

### 📄 [example_task.json](https://github.com/giorgioroth/ContinuumPort/blob/main/examples/example_task.json)
This is a high-precision technical reporting container. It defines a complex industrial task (Bifacial PV Efficiency Report) with strict boundaries.

#### 🎥 Live Validation (Proof of Concept)
To see this specific JSON being processed in real-time by an unauthenticated, non-logged-in LLM session, watch the validation video:

**[ContinuumPort: Needlecasting Proof of Concept](https://youtu.be/4hFJ8tZUeHc)**

**Key observations in the video:**
* **Zero Semantic Decay**: The AI resumes the task exactly from the `current_needle`.
* **Non-Anthropomorphic Compliance**: The AI follows the `Strict RAW` constraint, bypassing conversational fillers.
* **Portability**: Validation performed in a "clean" session with no prior user history, proving the protocol carries all necessary context.
