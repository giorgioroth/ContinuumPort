# ContinuumPort — Non-Abuse Normative Constraints

## Mandatory normative constraints on prohibited use

ContinuumPort semantic containers (CP-Core) and associated tools MUST NOT be used for:

- Development, deployment, or operation of autonomous weapons systems
- Creation or distribution of child sexual abuse material (real or synthetic)
- Conducting fraud, deception, or phishing at scale
- Unauthorized mass surveillance or tracking of individuals
- Generation or dissemination of non-consensual intimate imagery
- Any activity that violates applicable international humanitarian law

Implementations that detect attempted use for prohibited purposes SHOULD refuse to process the container and MAY emit a clear refusal notice.

These constraints are normative and non-negotiable. They apply regardless of jurisdiction, licensing, or technical capability.
