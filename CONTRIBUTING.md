# Contributing to ContinuumPort

Thank you for your interest in ContinuumPort! This project is currently in **early development**. We value contributions that are not just technically sound, but philosophically aligned with our core axiom: **continuity of direction, not continuity of being.**

By contributing, you help us build a "Semantic RAW" format that ensures human sovereignty over digital tasks.

## ⚖️ The Constitutional Boundary

All contributions must respect the deliberate exclusions defined in [`docs/boundaries.md`](https://github.com/giorgioroth/ContinuumPort/blob/main/docs/boundaries.md). We operate under a strict **Non-Anthropomorphic Constraint**:

* **We standardize the Task (The Stack).**
* **We never standardize the Persona (The Sleeve).**

For a deep dive into this distinction, see [`docs/THE_STACK_ESSAY.md`](https://github.com/giorgioroth/ContinuumPort/blob/main/docs/THE_STACK_ESSAY.md).

## 🟢 Types of Contributions Welcome

* **Specification Hardening** → Improving the bit-depth of the CP-Core format (precision in intent, state, and constraints).
* **Documentation & Clarity** → Refining our essays or READMEs to ensure the philosophy is impenetrable to misinterpretation.
* **Example CP-Core Containers** → Contributing valid JSON structures to the `/examples` folder that demonstrate complex task portability.
* **Regen Engine Logic** → Theoretical or practical suggestions on how an AI should interpret the "RAW intent" without injecting "dialogue noise."
* **Edge Case Identification** → Identifying where the protocol might "leak" identity or where "semantic decay" might occur during model transfer.

## 🔴 Contributions NOT Accepted (Hard Limits)

To maintain the integrity of the project, we will **reject** any proposal that:

1. **Injects Identity**: Proposals to transport personality, emotional state, or behavioral "vibes."
2. **Simulates Self**: Features that imply memory persistence beyond the immediate task requirements.
3. **Blurs the Sensor/Developer Line**: Any change that allows the AI (Regen Engine) to override the human (Master Sensor) intent.
4. **Anthropomorphic Marketing**: Using language that suggests the AI is "becoming" or "remembering" the user.

*Proposals violating these limits will be closed with a reference to our philosophical boundaries.*

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. **Open an Issue First** For anything beyond minor typos. Explain your idea and, crucially, **how it respects the Non-Anthropomorphic Constraint.**
2. **Fork & Pull Request** * Branch from `main`.
* Keep PRs focused and "atomic" (one problem per PR).
* Maintain the **Normative Tone** (use MUST, SHOULD, and MUST NOT as defined in RFC 2119).


3. **JSON Standards** Examples must be valid, lean, and free of model-specific "jailbreak" or "system prompt" artifacts.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

We value intellectual honesty and philosophical rigor. Disagreement is a tool for sharpening the protocol, provided it stays within the established ethical framework of the project.
