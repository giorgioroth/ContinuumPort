## Non-Goals and Category Errors

**ContinuumPort** is frequently misinterpreted due to superficial analogies with memory systems, digital identity, or “persistent AI agents”.
This section defines explicitly what ContinuumPort **does not attempt to do**.

### Non-Goals

ContinuumPort is **not designed** to:

* Preserve user identity, personality, emotions, or personal history
* Maintain conversational continuity or relationship state
* Act as a persistent interlocutor, assistant, or companion
* Simulate cognition, consciousness, or agency
* Accumulate long-term memory across sessions
* Represent or reconstruct “presence” in digital form
* Optimize for engagement, empathy, or human likeness

Any system that attempts these goals is operating **outside** the ContinuumPort design boundary.

---

### Category Errors to Avoid

The following interpretations are **incorrect**:

* ContinuumPort as a “digital mind” or “cortical stack”
* ContinuumPort as a memory system for people or agents
* ContinuumPort as a semantic web or data interoperability protocol
* ContinuumPort as a way to “save conversations”
* ContinuumPort as a foundation for autonomous agents

These interpretations confuse **continuity of work** with **continuity of being**.

---

### Design Boundary (Normative)

ContinuumPort preserves **only**:

* task intent
* structured working state
* actionable semantic constraints

It explicitly excludes:

* identity continuity
* emotional state
* narrative history
* presence simulation

This exclusion is not a limitation.
It is a **deliberate design choice**.

---

### Principle

> **Continuity is not a substitute for presence.**
> ContinuumPort exists only for moments *after* presence is no longer possible.

Anything that is still alive, situated, and unfolding **should not be ported**.


### Summary

ContinuumPort is a tool for **semantic work continuity**, not for preserving human experience.
When used outside this boundary, it becomes a category mistake.

The system is useful precisely because it knows when to stay out of the way.
