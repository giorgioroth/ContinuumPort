# ContinuumPort — Negative Guarantees

This document defines what ContinuumPort explicitly guarantees **not** to do.

These are not limitations.  
They are architectural commitments.

ContinuumPort is defined as much by its absences as by its structure.  
These absences exist to prevent boundary collapse between tool and self.

---

## 1. No Identity Continuity

ContinuumPort does not preserve, reconstruct, simulate, or imply identity.

- No user identity  
- No model identity  
- No persona  
- No persistent self  

Any sense of *“who was here before”* lies outside the protocol boundary.

---

## 2. No Emotional State

ContinuumPort does not encode, infer, or transport emotion.

- No mood  
- No affective state  
- No emotional residue  

Emotions belong to humans.  
They are not portable semantic state.

---

## 3. No Memory

ContinuumPort does not preserve conversational history or experiential memory.

- No “last time you said…”  
- No recalled interactions  
- No autobiographical continuity  

Inference is assumed to be ephemeral by design.  
Persistence belongs to documentation, not to execution state.

---

## 4. No Temporal Anchoring

ContinuumPort does not encode time as a semantic signal.

- No timestamps  
- No creation dates  
- No temporal ordering  

Chronological time belongs to documentation and version control —  
not to portable work state.

---

## 5. No Agency or Intent Attribution

ContinuumPort does not assign agency, understanding, or decision ownership.

- No autonomy  
- No self-directed intent  
- No responsibility delegation  

Agency remains with the human.  
Execution remains with the tool.

---

## 6. No Implicit Inference

ContinuumPort does not permit meaning to be inferred from:

- absence  
- proximity  
- implication  
- narrative structure  

Only explicitly declared state is valid.

Anything not declared does not exist within the protocol.

---

## 7. No Optimization for Convenience

ContinuumPort does not optimize for:

- friendliness  
- empathy  
- conversational flow  
- anthropomorphic comfort  

These are interface concerns.

The protocol optimizes for:

- correctness  
- portability  
- restraint  
- epistemic clarity  

---

## Summary

ContinuumPort guarantees that it will **not** evolve into:

- a memory system  
- an identity layer  
- a narrative archive  
- a surrogate self  

It exists to preserve work — and nothing else.

---

**Continuity of work.**  
**Never continuity of presence.**
