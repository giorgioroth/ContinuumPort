# CP-Core: Work Continuity Without Presence Continuity  

## Overview

This document defines a **CP-Core semantic container** used to stabilize and externalize the working state of the ContinuumPort project.

It condenses an extended design and validation phase into a **task-oriented semantic snapshot**, explicitly excluding identity, emotion, autobiographical memory, and conversational history.

The objective is **continuity of work without continuity of presence**.

## Usage Constraints

**Normative rule:**

This container must not be edited to reflect ongoing activity.
It represents a **semantic freeze point**, not a living log.

* If work resumes after interruption: resume from this container.
* If work does not resume: the container remains sufficient as-is.

Valid uses include:

* archival reference,
* clean-session restart point,
* cross-model handoff artifact.

---

## Explicit Non-Uses

This CP-Core is **not**:

* a diary,
* a narrative record,
* an autobiographical artifact,
* a substitute for presence.

It provides exactly what ContinuumPort defines:

**work continuity without presence continuity.**

---

## Optional Continuations

If continuation occurs, valid next steps are limited to:

* a reduced operational CP-Core variant,
* a strictly procedural resumption artifact,
* independent replication in another clean environment.

No continuation is required.

This container is intended to rest.
