# Academic Foundations of CP-NORM-H01

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides the academic positioning and theoretical framing of **CP-NORM-H01** within existing research and institutional traditions.

It does **not** introduce new concepts.  
It does **not** extend the norm.  
It exists solely to clarify *why* CP-NORM-H01 is structured as a norm and *how* it relates to established academic domains.

## The Problem Being Addressed

As AI-assisted work becomes longer, more collaborative, and more distributed, a recurring structural problem emerges:

**the conflation of human presence with the continuity of work.**

In practice, this manifests as:
- attempts to preserve identity across sessions,
- attempts to preserve emotional or conversational context,
- attempts to simulate presence as a proxy for continuity.

While such approaches may improve short-term usability, they introduce long-term risks:
- semantic drift,
- unbounded context accumulation,
- loss of auditability,
- ambiguity over authorship and responsibility.

CP-NORM-H01 addresses this problem by asserting a strict boundary between **work continuity** and **human presence**.

## Relation to Academic Domains

CP-NORM-H01 intersects with several academic and institutional traditions, without belonging fully to any single one.

### Anticipatory Systems
In anticipatory systems theory, present structure is shaped by constraints imposed on future states.  
CP-NORM-H01 functions similarly by defining *what must not propagate* across system boundaries.

The norm does not predict future behavior.  
It constrains permissible continuity.

### Safety and Boundary Norms
In engineering, aviation, and occupational safety, norms often define:
- operational limits,
- mandatory cutoffs,
- points where processes must stop or reset.

CP-NORM-H01 follows this tradition:
it does not optimize performance, but enforces a safety boundary for semantic transfer.

### Knowledge Transfer and Handoff Practices
In organizational theory, effective handoff depends on reducing ambiguity rather than preserving total context.

CP-NORM-H01 formalizes this principle:
only stabilized, task-relevant meaning may cross a handoff boundary.

## What CP-NORM-H01 Is Not

CP-NORM-H01 is **not**:
- an agent framework,
- a memory system,
- a human–computer interaction model,
- a collaboration platform,
- a software protocol.

It does not define message formats, APIs, or execution mechanisms.  
It does not prescribe workflows or tools.

Any implementation details exist **outside** the norm.

---

## Why a Norm, Not a Model

Academic models aim to explain, predict, or optimize phenomena.  
Protocols aim to enable interoperability.

CP-NORM-H01 does neither.

It defines a **limit condition**.

Specifically, it establishes that:
- identity must not persist across sessions,
- emotional or autobiographical state must not transfer,
- subjective presence must not be simulated as continuity.

Only task-oriented semantic structure is permitted to propagate.

This makes CP-NORM-H01 a **normative boundary**, not a descriptive or generative theory.

---

## Applicability and Explicit Limits

CP-NORM-H01 is not intended for all domains.

In exploratory or hard-science contexts—such as drug discovery, experimental machine learning, or mathematical research—the full trajectory of exploration is part of the result and must be preserved exhaustively.

In such cases:
- intermediate hypotheses,
- rejected paths,
- execution logs,
- parameter sweeps

are essential and must not be discarded.

CP-NORM-H01 does not attempt to support this mode of work.

It becomes relevant **after exploration**, when meaning has stabilized and work must be transferred, paused, or resumed without ambiguity.

---

## Closure

CP-NORM-H01 asserts a simple but non-negotiable principle:

**Human presence belongs inside the session.  
Only work may cross the boundary.**

This document completes the academic positioning of the norm.  
No further theoretical expansion is intended.
