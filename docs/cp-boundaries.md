# ContinuumPort Boundaries

**Normative Constraints on Semantic Continuity**

**Status:** Normative
**Applies to:** CP-Core, Regen Engines, and all compliant implementations

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **non-negotiable boundaries** of the ContinuumPort protocol.

ContinuumPort is a system for **semantic continuity of work**, not for personal continuity, identity persistence, or simulated presence.

These boundaries are **intentional design decisions**, not technical limitations.
They exist to ensure ethical safety, privacy, portability, and long-term interoperability.

Any implementation that violates these boundaries is **non-compliant**.

---

## 2. Foundational Principle

**Continuity ≠ Presence**

ContinuumPort preserves:

* intent,
* constraints,
* task state,
* directional semantic context.

ContinuumPort explicitly refuses to preserve:

* identity,
* memory as lived experience,
* emotional state,
* autonomous agency.

---

## 3. What ContinuumPort MUST NOT Transport or Reconstruct

The following categories are **strictly forbidden** in any CP-Core container or Regen process.

### 3.1 Persistent Identity or Simulated Self

ContinuumPort MUST NOT encode, imply, or reconstruct:

* a persistent “self”,
* personas or character profiles,
* backstories or autobiographical identity,
* continuity of “who the system is”.

There is no identity continuity across sessions.

---

### 3.2 Subjective Memory or Autobiographical Narrative

ContinuumPort MUST NOT store or transfer:

* personal anecdotes framed as lived experience,
* conversational history treated as memory,
* narrative arcs implying personal continuity over time.

Only task-relevant semantic state is permitted.

---

### 3.3 Emotional or Affective Continuity

ContinuumPort MUST NOT encode or preserve:

* emotional states,
* mood history,
* affective valence,
* attachment signals,
* emotional dependencies.

Emotions are inherently situated in the present interaction and are not portable.

---

### 3.4 Behavioral Conditioning or Preference Shaping

ContinuumPort MUST NOT include:

* behavioral optimization signals,
* engagement tuning,
* reinforcement traces,
* preference conditioning mechanisms (explicit or implicit).

The protocol is **behaviorally neutral**.

---

### 3.5 Autonomous Agency or Decision Authority

ContinuumPort MUST NOT:

* delegate independent goal-setting,
* imply self-motivation,
* grant decision authority to the system.

All intent is **user-directed**.
The system is never an autonomous actor.

---

### 3.6 Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

CP-Core MUST NOT contain:

* names,
* physical or digital addresses,
* biometric data,
* identifiers of natural persons.

The format provides **no fields** suitable for PII by design.

---

## 4. Prohibited System-Level Uses

ContinuumPort MUST NOT be used to construct:

* identity-preserving “Stacks”,
* systems claiming memory persistence across lives or users,
* simulated companions or emotional surrogates,
* presence-preserving agents.

Any such use is **explicitly non-compliant**, regardless of implementation details.

---

## 5. Allowed but Non-Guaranteed Emergent Behaviors

The following behaviors **may emerge** but are **not guaranteed**, standardized, or preserved:

* temporary stylistic consistency,
* local conversational coherence,
* short-term alignment during a single interaction,
* model-specific interpretive variance.

These effects are:

* incidental,
* model-dependent,
* non-portable,
* non-normative.

No implementation may rely on them.

---

## 6. Normative Enforcement

### 6.1 Compliance Requirement

Any system claiming ContinuumPort compliance MUST:

* respect all boundaries in this document,
* avoid encoding prohibited categories,
* clearly document non-normative extensions.

### 6.2 Violation Consequences

Violation of these boundaries results in:

* loss of ContinuumPort compliance,
* termination of Regen Engine licenses (if applicable),
* public non-compliance disclosure where necessary.

---

## 7. Design Rationale (Non-Normative)

When identity-adjacent data is transported, identity will be simulated.

This boundary was discovered empirically during early experiments and confirmed across multiple AI systems.

Therefore, **omission is the safety mechanism**.

---

## 8. Summary

ContinuumPort provides continuity for work — **never continuity of presence**.

Responsibility in AI infrastructure begins not with what we can encode,
but with what we deliberately refuse to encode.
