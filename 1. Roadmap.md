# ContinuumPort Roadmap

**Towards a stable and widely adoptable v1.0 release.**

- [x] Core philosophy & boundaries documented  
  - [CP-START.md](cp-core/CP-NORM-H01/CP-START.md)  
    *(Foundational document defining scope, non-scope, and philosophical boundaries)*  
  - [CP-START-HANDOFF.schema.json](cp-core/CP-NORM-H01/CP-START-HANDOFF.schema.json)  
    *(Normative CP-Core handoff schema with explicit structural and boundary constraints)*

- [x] [CP-Core format specification](docs/SPECIFICATION.md)  
  *(Full JSON format with normative constraints and boundaries)*

- [x] [Example CP-Core containers](examples/)  
  *(Multiple varied examples + quickstart guide available)*

- [x] [Validation tools](tools/validator.py)  
  *(Automated schema validation, PII detection, and non-anthropomorphic constraint enforcement)*

- [x] [Regen Engine specification](spec/regen-engine.md)  
  *(Normative requirements for conformant engines)*

- [x] [Community RFC process](CONTRIBUTING.md)  
  *(Formal guidelines with philosophical alignment)*

- [ ] Reference Regen Engine implementation  
  *(Planned – minimal conformant engine to demonstrate interoperability; non-optimized, focused on correctness)*

- [ ] v1.0 stable release  
  *(Frozen specification, production-tested tools, and multi-model interoperability validation)*
